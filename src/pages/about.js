                    These are 6-week long management consulting projects for
                    clients of varying backgrounds, from local non-profits to
                    billion dollar corporations. In the past year, we helped
                    an ed-tech startup with their alumni engagement model,
                    rebranded one of Chinaâ€™s largest social media platforms
                    engage with the US audience, and helped a local non-profit
                    craft a business model to best support food insecure students.
